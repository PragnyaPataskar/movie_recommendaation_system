# movie_recommendation_system

In this repository, you can find movie recommendations based on the movies you provide. It shows the top 5 matching movies with the provided input.

To make you aware of this project, let's start discussing how this recommendation system.

Definition of Recommendation System: It recommends similar types of data. It's been used in most social media networks.

Recommendation system are basically divided into 3 main types. Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering Based and the hybrid based (combination of Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering Based). Let's go further in detail how they approaches works and what they mean.

1. Content-Based: Here in this type of recommendation system, the system acts according to the content. For eg: is the user is watching some action movies, then the system recommend the action movies.
2. Collaborative Filtering Based: It is based on the user's interest in the content. It can also be said that the same content can be visible to a similar kind of user. For eg, let's just assume there are two user's User1, User2. First, User1 is watching a Documentary related to wildlife movies, the same will also be watched by User2. Next the User1 is watching some science-related movies, and meanwhile User2 is watching some action movies. Then it's also been assumed that User1 will also be interested in action movies, and inversely, User2 will be interested in  documentaries related to wildlife movies.
3. Hybrid- It's a combination of both the above approaches.

But here in this repository, you will find the movie recommendation system based on content.
