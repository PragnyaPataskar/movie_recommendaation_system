In this repository you can find movie recommendation based on the movie you provided. It shows the top 5 matching movies with the provided input.

To make you aware about this project let's start discussing how this recommendation systems.

Defination of Recommendation System: It recommends the similar types of data. Its been used in the most of the social media networks.

Recommendation system are basically divided into 3 main types. Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering Based and the hybrid based (combination of Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering Based). Let's go further in detail how they approaches works and what they mean.

1. Content-Based: Here in this type of recommendation system, the system acts according to the content. For eg: is the user is watching some action movies, then the system recommend the action movies.
2. Collaborative Filtering Based: It is based on the user's interest in the content. It can also be said that the same content can be visible to the similar kind of user. For eg: let's just assume there are two user's User1, User2. Fist User1 is watching some Documentary related to wild life movies, the same will be also watched by user2. Next the User1 is watching some science related moviews, and meanwhile User2 is watching some action mmovies. Then it's also been assumed that User1 will be aslo interested in action movies and inversly User2 will be intereted in  Documentary related to wild life movies.
3. Hybrid- It's combination of both the above approach.
